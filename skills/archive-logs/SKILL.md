description: Archive Claude Code conversation logs into the current project as JSONL and readable Markdown

Archive the Claude Code conversation logs from this project into the project itself, for auditability and transparency.

## Workflow

1. **Find logs**: Look in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/` where the encoded path replaces `/` with `-` in the current working directory path. List `*.jsonl` files (top-level only, not subdirectories).

2. **Identify sessions**: For each JSONL, extract the first user message to understand the session topic. Skip files with 0 user messages. Assign descriptive numbered names (e.g. `01_initial_setup.jsonl`, `02_feature_work.jsonl`).

3. **Check for duplicates**: If `logs/conversation/` already exists, compare against existing files to avoid re-archiving.

4. **Copy JSONL files** into `logs/conversation/` in the project.

5. **Create a converter script** at `scripts/jsonl_to_markdown.py` that converts JSONL to readable Markdown. The JSONL format:
   - Each line is a JSON object with a `type` field
   - Types `user` and `assistant` contain `message.content` (string or array of content blocks)
   - Content block types: `text` (render), `tool_use` (show tool name + concise input), `tool_result` (abbreviate), `thinking` (omit)
   - Filter out `<system-reminder>` tags from user messages
   - Skip tool_result-only user messages

6. **Run the converter** to generate `.md` files alongside the `.jsonl` files.

7. **Scan for secrets**: Install `detect-secrets` (`uv add --dev detect-secrets` or ensure it's available), then run `detect-secrets scan logs/conversation/` on all archived files (both `.jsonl` and `.md`). If any secrets are detected:
   - Print a clear warning listing each file and the line number(s) flagged.
   - Do NOT commit the files. Instead, ask the user how to proceed (redact, skip the file, or abort).
   - Secrets often appear in bash tool stdout/stderr in the JSONL. Common sources: `echo $API_KEY`, env variable dumps, credential outputs.

8. **Write `logs/conversation/README.md`** listing each session.

9. **Report** what was archived (and whether the secret scan passed cleanly).
